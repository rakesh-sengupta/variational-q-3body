We present a variational quantum simulation framework for semiclassical $N-$body dynamics on discrete-register, gate-model devices. We introduce a compact and hardware-efficient variational ansatz composed of a per-body mixture-of-Gaussians amplitude model augmented by a shallow, global entangling-phase layer. The time evolution is governed by McLachlan's variational principle, which we implement using analytically derived parameter gradients. We benchmark this framework on the one-dimensional three-body gravitational problem, comparing the variational dynamics against a numerically exact Trotter-Suzuki baseline in a 512-dimensional Hilbert space. Our results demonstrate that the compact 24-parameter ansatz accurately reproduces the trajectory of the central body, while larger deviations for the outer bodies quantify the expressivity limits of the shallow manifold. We analyze the dominant sources of error, primarily ansatz bias, and propose a clear roadmap for systematically improving accuracy by enhancing ansatz expressivity and developing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. This work establishes an analytically tractable and resource-efficient approach for simulating interacting many-body systems, providing a promising pathway for near-term quantum advantage.
